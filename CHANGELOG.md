# Changelog

All notable changes to the Llampaca project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to Semantic Versioning and complies with development logging guidelines.

## [2026-07-10]

### Added

- **Database Storage (`llampaca/engine/db.py`)**: Integrated SQLite-based persistent storage for conversation history. Added tables `conversations` (UUID identifier, title, model, timestamps) and `messages` (role, content, creation timestamp) with `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints. Uses WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) and a busy timeout to support concurrent writes by multiple agents.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented connection managers and functions to create, query, list, update, and delete conversations and messages.
- **Auto-Titling Logic**: Automatically sets the conversation title using a truncated snippet of the first user message when a conversation is initialized with the default title.
- **Unit Tests (`tests/test_db.py`)**: Added test coverage verifying the schema integrity, auto-titling thresholds, message cascade deletions, and timestamp-based sorting.
- **edit_file tool; hardened web_search**:
  - **`llampaca/tools/filesystem.py`** — New `edit_file(path, old_text, new_text)` tool (confirmation-gated, like `write_file`). Replaces an exact snippet inside a file, leaving the rest untouched.
  - **`llampaca/tools/web.py`** — `web_search` now tries two DuckDuckGo endpoints ("lite", then "html") with per-endpoint parsers, decodes redirect wrappers, and filters out sponsored results.
- **File search tools and date-aware system prompt**:
  - **`llampaca/tools/filesystem.py`** — New `find_files(pattern)` and `search_text(text, path)` tools, plus a shared `_iter_searchable_files()` walker that prunes VCS/cache/dependency directories and hidden entries.
  - **`llampaca/agent/loop.py`** — The system prompt now ends with today's date to help local models with temporal search.
- **Web search tool (Roadmap item: "DeepSearch / web search integration")**:
  - **`llampaca/tools/web.py`** — New `web_search(query)` tool using DuckDuckGo's no-JavaScript lite endpoint.
  - **`llampaca/agent/loop.py`** — Updated `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to suggest `web_search` for current/possibly-changed facts.
- **Agent session crashed on a mid-turn server error handling**:
  - **`llampaca/agent/loop.py`** — Reworked error handling in `Agent.send()` to report errors via `("error", ...)` events while keeping the session alive.
  - **`llampaca/cli.py`** — Renders `("error", ...)` in red and wraps turns in a try/except safety net.
- **Agentic tool-execution loop**:
  - **`llampaca/tools/registry.py`** — New `ToolRegistry`/`Tool` classes to auto-generate JSON schemas from type hints and docstrings.
  - **`llampaca/tools/filesystem.py`** — Sandboxed `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory` tools.
  - **`llampaca/tools/shell.py`** — Gated `run_shell_command` execution.
  - **`llampaca/tools/web.py`** — HTML-to-text `fetch_url`.
  - **`llampaca/tools/__init__.py`** — `build_default_registry()` helper.
  - **`llampaca/agent/loop.py`** — New `Agent` class driving the agentic loop.
- **Developer tooling**:
  - **`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`** — Recipe for building/launching/driving Llampaca end-to-end to verify changes.

### Changed

- **Configuration (`llampaca/config.py`)**: Added `DB_PATH` parameter pointing to `~/.llampaca/history.db`.
- **Documentation (`README.md`)**: Updated the layout table, database specification section, and CLI reference.
- **Server Database Integration (`llampaca/engine/server.py` & `db.py`)**: Defined `self.db` in `LlamaServer` and added `db_path` alias.
- **CLI Commands (`llampaca/cli.py`)**: Updated `history list` and `delete` commands to run asynchronously using `asyncio.run()`.
- **Interactive Chat Database Integration (`llampaca/cli.py`)**: Integrated conversation selection at start, saving user prompts and assistant final responses in real-time.
- **`llampaca/engine/client.py`** — Added `chat_stream_events()` for structured streaming and tool call reassembly.
- **`llampaca/engine/server.py`** — Pass `--jinja` when launching llama-server to support tool calling.
- **`llampaca/cli.py`** — `run` command now drives the `Agent` and renders its events, with a `--no-tools` flag for plain chat mode.

### Removed

- **`llampaca/agent/base.py`** — Deleted the empty `LocalAgent` scaffold.
